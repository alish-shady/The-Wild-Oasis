## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/the-wild-oasis.git](https://github.com/your-username/the-wild-oasis.git)
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Set up your Supabase backend. You will need to create a new project on
    [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) and get your project URL and anon key.
4.  Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Supabase
    credentials:
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    VITE_SUPABASE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    ```
5.  In your Supabase project, you'll need to create the necessary tables and
    relationships. You can find the schema in the course materials or by
    inspecting the code.

```sh
npm run dev
