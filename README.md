## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/the-wild-oasis.git](https://github.com/your-username/the-wild-oasis.git)
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up Supabase**

    - You will need to create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)
      to get your project URL and anon key.
    - Navigate to the `src/services/supabase.js` file (or wherever your Supabase
      client is initialized).
    - Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase URL and key.

    ```javascript
    // Example from src/services/supabase.js

    import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
    export const supabaseUrl = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL";
    const supabaseKey = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY";
    const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);

    export default supabase;
    ```

    - In your Supabase project, you'll also need to create the necessary tables
      and relationships as shown in the course.

### Usage

To run the app in development mode, run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```
